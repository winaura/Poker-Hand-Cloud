##TableInfo
TableInfo.TexasPoker:The most popular variant of poker today. A game with two hole cards and five community cards that are used by all players to make hands
TableInfo.RoyalPoker:A special kind of poker with the same rules as Texas Holdem, but using only the highest-ranking cards. When calculating your odds of winning, don't forget that there are no low-ranking cards in the pack. A hand that could be quite impressive in ordinary poker may be one of the weakest at the table in ROYAL POKER
TableInfo.JokerPoker:Joker Poker is a common variation on Texas Holdem. This universal card makes the game more unpredictable and increases the chances of making rare hands like a royal flush, a straight flush, or quads. When playing Joker Poker it's important to know how to make a hand with the joker and understand the value of all the combinations
TableInfo.SitnGo:A poker tournament for 5 players that starts when all the places are taken. The prize pool consists of the players' BUY-INs. The winner takes the maximum payout, and the player who places second gets their BUY-IN back. The players start with a fixed sum according to the level of the tournament, and the blinds increase every 4 rounds
TableInfo.DashPoker:Classic Texas Holdem, but when you fold, you immediately move to a new hand with new opponents
